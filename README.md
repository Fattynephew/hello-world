# hello-world
My first repository

Wasup Everybody.

My name is Jordan Harris, and I am a student at the University of Houston. I am hoping to have a great deal of fun learning how to code, and write my own code for various personal and educational purposes. 

I will try to make at least one change per day to this repository just to stay consistant and motivated to log on each and every day.
